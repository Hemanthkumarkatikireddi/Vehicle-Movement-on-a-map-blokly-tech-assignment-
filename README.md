# About
This is a frontend-only web application that simulates a vehicle moving on a map. The application should display the vehicle's live position and draw its route using dummy data. 
I'm using **React.js**, **Leaflet**, and **Leaflet Routing Machine**.  
It allows users to visualize a car moving along a route between two points — with speed control, play/pause functionality, and day selection (Today / Yesterday).

## Live Demo
🔗 **Deployed on Netlify:** [View Live Project](https://lambent-ganache-e4a721.netlify.app/)

## Features

1. Interactive map powered by **Leaflet.js**  
2. Real-time **vehicle movement animation** 
3. Select between **Today** and **Yesterday** routes  
4. **Speed control** – Slow / Normal / Fast / Very Fast  
5. **Play & Pause** vehicle movement anytime  
6. Automatically clears old routes when new destination is selected  
7. Fully responsive React functional component structure
